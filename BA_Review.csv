REVIEW
no sandwiches left to purchase
another very good flight
don't provide free food and drink
way below expected service
onboard charity collection is inappropriate
staff were so friendly
comfort and service superb
good overall experience
cabin crew were very friendly
delayed by 20 mins
middle name was not on her ticket
charged 4 times for one bag
cabin manager did not greet me
no proof I paid for them
Awful airline
 Flight is again delayed
This flight was a delight
we had to print out boarding passes
You get what you pay for
"Awful, rude airline"
Seats the same as economy
we had limited recline seats seats
Overall a good flight
crew are so friendly
excellent with service
cabin crew where fantastic
utter nightmares
the shortage of staff
lacks personalized attention
missed my connecting flight
said that I need to check my baggage
inflight service was distinctly average
delayed due to maintenance
cabin crew were so kind
Will never fly BA again
very disappointed with the service they provide
Surprisingly good flight
plane was old and cramped
Movie selection below average
What a disappointment of an airline
I begrudge flying with them
excellent premium host service
a remarkably bad experience
It used to be a good airline
left a great deal to be desired
Food was fairly good both ways
a very friendly and welcoming crew
Great service on this flight
"They were friendly, welcoming"
find an alternative airline
pleased with all aspects
still awaiting a refund
loved every minute of the flight
don’t trust BA with your loved ones
downgraded to premium economy
seems they were understaffed
offering an ultra low cost service
Food was fine and service friendly
Service was fantastic
check in counter was closed
no free food nor drink
we had an excellent flight
very happy with this short flight
Worst customer experience
three hours to get rebooking
an awesome experience
seat are surprisingly comfortable
clueless staff full of attitude
Extremely poor communication
The seat was uncomfortable
did not mention it was normal coffee
crew were very attentive
45 minutes before my bag came
comfortable seats
glorified budget airline
easily the most cramped space I have ever flown
Seats were uncomfortable
It’s almost like a low cost
Couldn’t ask for more
zero feeling of comfort
they were really good
cancelled and rescheduled
the experience was outstanding
first and definitely last time
appreciate your excellent service
one of the worst experiences
seats on the flight were comfortable
seats are incredibly uncomfortable
such a pleasant experience
Another pleasant flight
Better than I was expecting
zero customer service
there is no lounge at Kos
Club Europe had no advantages
Very enjoyable flight
No room to move
"staff wonderful. cheerful, efficient"
it was the most enjoyable flight
I never received the refund
"not too bad, all in all"
no sandwiches left to purchase
